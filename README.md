Visualise and animate a dicom data series

This simple python script allows you to create an interactive 3D visualisation of a DICOM series; moreover, it animates the scene with a camera rotation about the azimuth. 

It is aimed at medical physics students who work with DICOM for their research, and who are looking for an eye catching animation for a conference presentation, or are just interested in exploring their data in 3D.
